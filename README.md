# JavaScript-Projects
### Here are some of the main projects that I made using JavaScript

* Pizza Menu Project
* Tic-Tac-Toe Game
* To-Do List Application

### Pizza Menu Project
This project is a basic pizza menu web page that I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
where a user can place an order for a pizza. The user can interact with the web page and
choose the size, and toppings. It then calculates the total depending on what the user added.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a quick game of tic tac toe that I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
where a user goes up against a bot to connect 3 in a row. There are visual and audio cues in
the game to make it more appealing to the user.

### Calculator
This project is a simple calculator with some styling on the buttons. With this application, you can
do basic math like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
